# Stage 0 findings

What the proofs changed. This is the output of stage 0 — the types compiling is
the easy half; what they could not express on the first attempt is the half
worth writing down.

Method: write the four types, then express Kova's three hardest routes and
Scena's three hardest collections in them, then assert the mistakes that must not
compile. Six real surfaces, eight negative assertions.

---

## 1. `shape` did not exist, and one route required it

The first `operation` had `permission`, `entitlement` and `customerFlag` as
all-or-nothing gates. Kova's progress read has four lenses in one payload, of
which a customer's package may include two.

All three obvious behaviours are wrong. Refusing takes the ungated lenses down
with the sold ones. Returning everything gives away what was not bought.
Returning a quietly thinner payload makes "withheld" and "empty" the same
answer, so the screen cannot tell either.

`shape: Record<key, flag>` was added, and the response reports `included`. A
type without it would have pushed this back into a hand-rolled per-app check,
which is where it currently lives and why it once shipped ungated.

## 2. `Scope` needed a `platform` variant, with a reason attached

A collection type that assumes tenancy cannot express a licensed catalogue every
workspace draws from. Making the scope a union forces the choice to be stated;
requiring `why` on the platform variant means a table outside the tenant cascade
carries its own justification, next to the declaration, where somebody adding a
cascade will read it.

Verified negatively: `scope: { of: "platform" }` with no `why` does not compile.

## 3. Annotating a *missing* field and a *wrong* field differ

`@ts-expect-error` for a missing required property must sit on the **call**;
for a wrong value it sits on the **property**. Getting it backwards produces
`TS2578: Unused '@ts-expect-error' directive`, which reads exactly like the
guard having failed to fire.

Two of the first eight assertions were misplaced this way. Both guards were
working. Worth knowing before writing the next negative proof, because the
failure mode is a false negative that looks like a real one.

## 4. `AppSpec.operations` needs `any`, and that is a real gap

```ts
readonly operations: readonly OperationSpec<B, any, any>[];
```

A heterogeneous array of independently-generic operations has no clean type
without existentials. It works, but it means the app-level composition cannot
check that an operation's `fails` names a declared problem, or that `emits`
names a declared notification.

⚠️ **Those checks are why the manifest exists**, so they cannot be lost. Stage 1
resolves it one of two ways: a builder that accumulates a union as operations are
registered, or a lint that reads the declarations. The builder is better —
compiler over script — and is worth trying first.

## 5. `HelpId` cannot be constructed yet

The proof casts (`"plans.publishing" as never`) because help ids are branded and
no help registry exists. Correct in the long run and awkward now.

Stage 6 declares help, and `HelpId` becomes a key of that registry. Until then,
the cast is a marker: it appears exactly where a real cross-link belongs.

## 6. `exifStrip` is asked of media that has no EXIF

Scena's audio track declares `exifStrip: false`, which is meaningless for an
audio file and reads as a decision somebody made.

⚠️ Left as-is deliberately. The alternative — inferring it from the `accept`
list — makes the safe default depend on a MIME pattern, and the first time
somebody writes `accept: ["*/*"]` the inference silently picks the wrong answer
for images. A meaningless `false` on an audio field is cheaper than a wrong
`false` on a photograph, and this is the one day-zero field where arriving late
helps nothing: stripping metadata next year does not clean what was uploaded
this year.

## 7. Branded outputs are not yet used at the edges

`publishPlan` returns `{ publishedAt: string }` rather than `Instant`. The
branded types protect storage but the proof's own outputs bypass them.

Stage 2 should make the operation's `output` schema carry branded types so the
protection reaches the wire, not just the column. Cheap now, and exactly the
kind of thing that stops being cheap once fifty operations exist.

---

## What did NOT need changing

Worth recording, because it is evidence the shape is close:

- **`defineBindings`** expressed all five of Kova's stores, including a
  content-addressed bucket and a relocatable durable actor, unchanged.
- **`Problem`** covered both apps' failure vocabulary with no additions.
- **`Idempotency`'s three modes** covered every case in the proofs: a read
  (`none`), a natural key (`planId`), and a provider's event id
  (`client-supplied`).
- **`collection`** expressed a device, an ordered child row and a platform-wide
  catalogue without a special case beyond finding 2.

## Verified as unrepresentable

Eight mistakes, each one this repository has paid for, now rejected by the
compiler rather than by review: epoch milliseconds as an instant, a wall date as
an instant, a float as money, money without a currency, a client id as a plan id,
a cache holding personal data, a collection without a version, an operation
without an idempotency decision, and a tool hidden with no stated reason.
